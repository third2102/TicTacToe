This is a website where two people can play tictactoe

To run, checkout a copy and run npm start
-You might have to run npm install beforehand

X goes first

Square has some unit tests on it so feel free to check those out

Next Steps:
  Fix bugs with undo once the game is over
  Add unit tests to Board
  Pull the buttons into their own component
  Possibly move state to the app instead of the board
